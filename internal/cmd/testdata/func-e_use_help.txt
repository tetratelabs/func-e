NAME:
   func-e use - Sets the current [version] used by the "run" command

USAGE:
   func-e use [version]

DESCRIPTION:
   The '[version]' is from the "versions -a" command.
   The Envoy [version] installs on-demand into $FUNC_E_HOME/versions/[version]
   if needed. You may also exclude the patch component of the [version]
   to use the latest patch version or to download the binary if it is
   not already downloaded.

   This updates $PWD/.envoy-version or $FUNC_E_HOME/version with [version],
   depending on which is present.

   Example:
   $ func-e use 1.35.0
   $ func-e use 1.35
