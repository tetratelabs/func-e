NAME:
   func-e - Install and run Envoy

USAGE:
   To run Envoy, execute `func-e run -c your_envoy_config.yaml`. This
   downloads and installs the latest version of Envoy for you.

   To list versions of Envoy you can use, execute `func-e versions -a`. To
   choose one, invoke `func-e use 1.35.3`. This installs into
   `$FUNC_E_HOME/versions/1.35.3`, if not already present. You may also use
   minor version, such as `func-e use 1.35`.

   You may want to override `$ENVOY_VERSIONS_URL` to supply custom builds or
   otherwise control the source of Envoy binaries. When overriding, validate
   your JSON first: https://archive.tetratelabs.io/release-versions-schema.json

   Advanced:
   `FUNC_E_PLATFORM` overrides the host OS and architecture of Envoy binaries.
   This is used when emulating another platform, e.g. x86 on Apple Silicon M1.
   Note: Changing the OS value can cause problems as Envoy has dependencies,
   such as glibc. This value must be constant within a `$FUNC_E_HOME`.
