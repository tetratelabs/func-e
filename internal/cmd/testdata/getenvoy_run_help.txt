NAME:
   getenvoy run - Run Envoy with the given [arguments...], collecting process state on termination

USAGE:
   getenvoy run [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   The version of Envoy run is chosen from $ENVOY_VERSION, $PWD/.envoy-version, $GETENVOY_HOME/version
   The '[arguments...]' are interpreted by Envoy.
   
   Envoy uses $GETENVOY_HOME/runs/$epochtime as the working directory.
   Upon termination, this is archived as $GETENVOY_HOME/runs/$epochtime.tar.gz.
   
   Example:
   $ getenvoy run -c ./bootstrap.yaml
