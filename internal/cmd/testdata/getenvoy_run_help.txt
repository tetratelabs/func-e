NAME:
   getenvoy run - Run Envoy with the given [arguments...] until interrupted

USAGE:
   getenvoy run [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   To run Envoy, execute `getenvoy run -c your_envoy_config.yaml`.
   
   The first version in the below is run, controllable by the "use" command:
   ```
   $ENVOY_VERSION, $PWD/.envoy-version, $GETENVOY_HOME/version
   ```
   The version to use is downloaded and installed, if necessary.
   
   Envoy interprets the '[arguments...]' and runs in the current working
   directory (aka $CWD) until getenvoy is interrupted (ex Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Break).
   
   Console output is captured as "stdout.log" and "stderr.log" in the run
   directory (`$GETENVOY_HOME/runs/$epochtime`). When interrupted,
   shutdown hooks write files, including admin endpoints, network and process
   state. Upon exit, these zip into `$GETENVOY_HOME/runs/$epochtime.tar.gz`
