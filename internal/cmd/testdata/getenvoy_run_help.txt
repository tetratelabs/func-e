NAME:
   getenvoy run - Run Envoy with the given [arguments...], running shutdown hooks on Ctrl-C

USAGE:
   getenvoy run [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   To run Envoy, execute `getenvoy run -c your_envoy_config.yaml`. This
   downloads and installs the latest version of Envoy for you.
   
   Envoy runs in the current directory and interprets the '[arguments...]'.
   The first version in the below is run, controllable by the "use" command:
   ```
   $ENVOY_VERSION, $PWD/.envoy-version, $GETENVOY_HOME/version
   ```
   
   While Envoy is running, the run directory (`$GETENVOY_HOME/runs/$epochtime`)
   includes minimally "stdout.log" and "stderr.log". On Ctrl-C, shutdown hooks
   write troubleshooting files, including admin endpoints, network and process
   state. Upon exit, this archives as `$GETENVOY_HOME/runs/$epochtime.tar.gz`
