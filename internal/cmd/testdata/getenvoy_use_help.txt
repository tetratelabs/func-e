NAME:
   getenvoy use - Sets the current [version] used by the "run" command

USAGE:
   getenvoy use [version]

DESCRIPTION:
   The '[version]' is from the "versions -a" command.
   The Envoy [version] installs on-demand into $GETENVOY_HOME/versions/[version]
   if needed.
   
   This updates $PWD/.envoy-version or $GETENVOY_HOME/version with [version],
   depending on which is present.
   
   Example:
   $ getenvoy use {ENVOY_VERSION}
