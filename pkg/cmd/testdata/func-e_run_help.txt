NAME:
   func-e run - Run Envoy with the given [arguments...] until interrupted

USAGE:
   func-e run [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   To run Envoy, execute `func-e run -c your_envoy_config.yaml`.
   
   The first version in the below is run, controllable by the "use" command:
   ```
   $ENVOY_VERSION, $PWD/.envoy-version, $FUNC_E_HOME/version
   ```
   The version to use is downloaded and installed, if necessary.
   
   Envoy interprets the '[arguments...]' and runs in the current working
   directory (aka $PWD) until func-e is interrupted (ex Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Break).
   
   Envoy's process ID and console output write to "envoy.pid", stdout.log" and
   "stderr.log" in the run directory (`$FUNC_E_HOME/runs/$epochtime`).
   When interrupted, shutdown hooks write files including network and process
   state. On exit, these archive into `$FUNC_E_HOME/runs/$epochtime.tar.gz`
