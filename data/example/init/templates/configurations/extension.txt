// We recommend to use json as the configuration format,
// however, some languages (e.g. TinyGo) does not support ready-to-use json library as of now.
// As a temporary alternative, we use ".txt" format.
//
// Note that when using ".txt" format, lines starting with "//" are entirely discarded by GetEnvoy,
// and never passed to Envoy in "getenvoy extension run" command.
// Therefore, the lines above (including this line) are ignored.
