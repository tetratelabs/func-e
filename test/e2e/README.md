# GetEnvoy End-to-end (e2e) tests

This directory holds the end-to-end tests for `getenvoy`.

By default, end-to-end (e2e) tests verify a `getenvoy` binary built from [/pkg][../../pkg]

Ex run this from the project root:
```shell
make e2e
```

You can override the binary tested by setting `E2E_GETENVOY_BINARY` to an alternative location, for example a release.

## Version of Envoy under test
The envoy version used in tests default to what's in [/internal/reference.txt](../../internal/reference/reference.txt).

## Development Notes

### Don't share code between here and /pkg
This is an end-to-end test of the `getenvoy` binary: it is easy to get confused about what is happening when some code
is in the binary and other shared. Place e2e utilities here instead.

We historically added functions into main only for e2e and left them after they became unused. Adding code into /pkg
also effects its code health statistics. Treat e2e as a separate project even though it shares a [go.mod](../../go.mod)
with /pkg.

Please refrain from using utilities in [/pkg](../../pkg). In exceptional circumstances, move code already used by /pkg
into [/internal](../../internal) when sharing.

### Be careful when adding dependencies
Currently, e2e shares [go.mod](../../go.mod) with [/pkg](../../pkg). This is for simplification in build config and also
details such as linters. However, we carry a risk of dependencies used here ending up accidentally used in /pkg. The IDE
will think this is the same project as /pkg and suggest libraries with auto-complete.

For example, if /pkg used "archiver/v3" accidentally, it would bloat the binary by almost 3MB. For this reason, please
be careful and only add dependencies absolutely needed.

If go.mod ever supports test-only scope, this risk would go away, because IDEs could hide test dependencies from main
auto-complete suggestions. However, it is unlikely go will allow a test scope: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26913
