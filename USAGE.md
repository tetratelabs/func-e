# func-e Overview
To run Envoy, execute `func-e run -c your_envoy_config.yaml`. This
downloads and installs the latest version of Envoy for you.

To list versions of Envoy you can use, execute `func-e versions -a`. To
choose one, invoke `func-e use 1.20.0`. This installs into
`$FUNC_E_HOME/versions/1.20.0`, if not already present. You may also use
minor version, such as `func-e use 1.20`.

You may want to override `$ENVOY_VERSIONS_URL` to supply custom builds or
otherwise control the source of Envoy binaries. When overriding, validate
your JSON first: https://archive.tetratelabs.io/release-versions-schema.json

Advanced:
`FUNC_E_PLATFORM` overrides the host OS and architecture of Envoy binaries.
This value must be constant within a `$FUNC_E_HOME`.
