# Using these in tests and as a parent (FROM) avoids docker.io rate-limits particularly on pull requests.

# To troubleshoot, run locally with docker and install go directly. Ex:
# ```bash
# $ docker run -ti -v $PWD:/func-e --rm centos:8
# [root@d37da4601545 /]# cd /func-e
# now execute your setup commands!
